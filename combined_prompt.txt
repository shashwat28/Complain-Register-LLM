If I give you my description of my grievance or problems that I see around me along with screenshots, i.e. locally in my area, in my region and locality, would you be able to find and list out all the correct and viable sources where one can lodge or file his/her complaints ,
Basically, I just need relevant details of authorities and organizations where I can lodge complaints, be it websites, apps, whatsapp chats, social media handles etc, 

I have many grievance, its more like what I observe in day to day life, general stuffs, for example to list some:

1- illegal encroachments on roads and shops, or near houses
2- car drivers doing unnecessary road rage and getting away with crimes etc ( Here i will provide car details too)
3- unwarranted road blocks done by local authority without any reason provided
4- lack of public order or discipline, carried out regularly someplace
5- massive traffic violations happening at quite many places

These may be the nature of my grievance or problems to list some, but still barely scratching the surface.
